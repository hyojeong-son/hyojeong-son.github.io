# Hyojeong Son

<div class="intro">
  <p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:hjson@uw.edu">hjson@uw.edu</a>. Here is my
  <a href="{{ '/assets/files/Hyojeong_Son_CV.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CV</a>.</p>
</div>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the
<a href="https://math.washington.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematics Department</a> at the University of Washington, advised by
<a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~hoffman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Hoffman</a>.
My research is in discrete probability, especially particle models like activated random walks and sandpiles; I also study stable matching problems.
