  <p>
    Hello! I'm Hyojeong, a fourth-year graduate student in the <a href="https://math.washington.edu" target="_blank">Mathematics Department</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle, working under <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~hoffman/" target="_blank">Professor Christopher Hoffman</a>. I specialize in discrete probability, focusing on particle models like activated random walks and sandpiles. Additionally, I explore stable matching problems, investigating the number of possible matchings based on different preference structures. Welcome to my personal webpage! You can reach me at <a href="mailto:hjson@math.washington.edu">hjson@math.washington.edu</a>, and my office is Padelford PDL C-8K.
